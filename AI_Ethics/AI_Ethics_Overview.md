# Ethos

We believe that ethics, safety and inclusion should be an integral part of the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. 

These should be first-class citizens in the entire lifecycle of the product, service, application, etc. that you're building. Another analogy that you can use is that we'd rather this be "baked in, rather than bolted on".
