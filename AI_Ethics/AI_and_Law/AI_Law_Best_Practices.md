# AI and Law Best Practices

This is a place for the CSE community to reference and contribute to documenting best practices with respect to AI and law. It is important to note that this is not formal legal direction provided by CELA, rather it is intended to act as supplementary guidance. 

## Post Engagement Recommendations

It is recommended that following each engagement with a customer, the CSE engineer should complete a "code wash", removing all explicit **references and representations** of customer data in their code and/or notebooks, including visualizations, while retaining the generalized code for re-use in cases where the customer has signed the necessary legal agreements with Microsoft.
